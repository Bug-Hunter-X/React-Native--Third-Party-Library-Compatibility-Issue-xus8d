To address this issue, you should first check the compatibility of the third-party library with your current React Native version.  If it's outdated, update it to the latest version via npm or yarn. If updating isn't feasible or doesn't resolve the problem, try finding a suitable alternative library.  Sometimes, problems arise from misconfiguration; review the library's documentation carefully and ensure you've followed its setup instructions precisely. If all else fails, report the issue to the library's maintainers. Below is a possible solution showing an update and configuration check.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
// Update the library version
import Camera from 'react-native-camera'; // Check version compatibility

export default function MyComponent() {
  // ... rest of the component code
  // Check configurations and make adjustments if needed as per library docs
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Using Updated Library</Text>     
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }}/>
    </View>
  );
}
```
