# React Native Third-Party Library Compatibility Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky bug in React Native development: incompatibility issues with third-party libraries.  Specifically, we'll look at scenarios where outdated libraries or incorrect configuration lead to unexpected runtime errors or incorrect functionality. 

The `bug.js` file shows an example of a React Native component using a potentially incompatible library.  `bugSolution.js` offers a solution which may involve updating the library, switching to a compatible alternative, or adjusting configuration parameters.

This example aims to highlight best practices for managing third-party library dependencies in React Native to prevent and address such issues.
